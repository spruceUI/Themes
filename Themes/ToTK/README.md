Theme for spruceOS

I used the Cosy theme as a base and modified the BGM, and several icons, etc. This is my first theme, and just wanted to share what I currently use on my A30. Assets from Hyrule theme from Onion also borrowed. No luck with finding contact info for the author.

If the author of the Hyrule theme wishes to have this theme removed please contact SundownerSport on reddit or discord or at thespruceosteam@gmail.com
